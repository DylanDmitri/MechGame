=== Divine Sunderer ===
Stats: 40 AD, 20 AH, 400 HP
Scale: 5% APEN, 5% MPEN
Spellblade:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After using a spell, your next attack hits for 250% damage,
    and heals you for about 10 percent of your health bar.

    Against tanky enemies, this scales to dealing 350% damage,
    and healing for about 20 percent of your health bar.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While nominally anti-tank, the flat damage hurts squishies --
    against most 3-item ADCs, if you have sunderer + 2 other AD items, 
    each spellblade proc will hit for about a quarter of their HP bar.

    This wins most tank vs tank fights if you can consistently proc it.
    In a 10s skirmish, against an enemy with (sunfire, thornmail, sterak's)
        spellblade heals you for 40% of your hp
        spellblade deals 40% of enemy hp

=== Eclipse ===
Stats: 55 AD, 18 Lethality, 8% omnivamp
Scale: 4% APEN
Ever Rising Moon:
    deal 6% of their hp
    for 2 seconds
        15% movespeed
        15% of your health as shield

12% APEN + 15 = 30 armor reduction

=== Eclipse vs Divine Sunderer ===
    
    Both give damage and armor reduction (Eclipse wins slightly)
    Both give sustain (Sunderer wins)
        Eclipse relies on you to deal damage, with 8% omnivamp.
        Eclipse grants about a 200-300 point shield every 8 seconds.
        Sunderer gives 200-300 hp per swing, about 3x every 8 seconds.
        If you can deal 6k damage in 8s you break even.
        
    Sunderer gives +400 HP
    Eclipse gives speed boost
